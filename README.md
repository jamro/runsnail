# ðŸš€ Welcome to RunSnail project!

My submission to contest organized by [ATZOD](https://www.youtube.com/c/Atenznowodronach) (YouTube channel about FPV quadcopters). The contest was related to [Walksnail](https://walksnail.com/) technology which allows transmission of HD video from a quadcopter to FPV goggles. 

**The rules are simple**:
- In a creative way, answer the question: *"How does a snail walk?"*

Full rules of the contest are available [here](https://znowodronach.pl/pl/blog/KONKURS-Jak-chodzi-slimak/27)

If you haven't heard about FPV quadcopters before, check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ZbNhIoUp0) out :)
